### 🎯 Exploring the full spectrum of IT to build real-world solutions

As a passionate student at **Zone01 Oujda**, I'm committed to mastering the full landscape of IT. From low-level code to scalable backend systems, I aim to understand *how things work*—and how to make them work better.

💡 I love solving problems that demand deep thinking: **backend logic**, **system architecture**, **legacy code debugging**, and **algorithmic challenges**. Whether I’m working with **Golang**, **JavaScript frameworks** like *React / Next.js / Angular*, or diving into **Rust**, **C/C++**, and **Java (Spring Boot)**, I adapt quickly and always stay curious.
